# CodingAssignmentOIT
Repository for the given programming assignment!

Please place all your work in a public GitHub repo.  It must include the following to be considered:

1 - The runtime/executable version of your program.

this is a.exe, run this using g++ a.exe, after installing and setting up minGW!

2 - The source code of your program and everything we need to compile and run it.
	
Source code = RN_To_D.cpp
Other programs needed include MinGW installation to run C++ code through windows.
MinGW Installation site = https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
Video Tutorial = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWTocqPrzMk 
Note: I coded in c++, so the command he used to run his C code "gcc filename" is replaced with "g++ filename" to run my c++ code

3 - All your notes and documentation. If your notes are on paper take a clear picture of them and include them in the GitHub repo. We want to see your thinking as well. This is especially important if you do not finish all the coding.
	
Notes = did not have any extra notes besides a lot of comments in RN_To_D.cpp
I also included the whole problem in comments beneath all of my code in RN_To_D.cpp

4 - If your solution requires any external libraries, files, or software, please include them.

included previously in section 2.

5 - A note about the amount of time you spent on the challenge.

I would say I had 2 times, one when I completed the bare minimum and one after I added a somewhat messy but functional interactive loop that allows for users to input values and use the functions on the fly

Total time for the basic project was 1 hour and 20 minutes

Total time for the added interactivity was about 3 hours and 0 minutes.

6 - Whatever other documentation or comments you wish to include.

This was fun! 
I hope the interactive loop might count for something, but if not, I am confident at least that my basic functions are working properly!
One last note is that I didn't check for all the Roman Numeral rules when it comes to users entering in a Roman Numeral string as this would be rather complex and I already went above what I think was originally required!

Thanks again!
